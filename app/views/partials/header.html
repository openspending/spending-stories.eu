            <p class="lead">Subsidystories.eu intends to <strong>increase transparency of EU-Funds</strong> by unravelling how the European Structural Investment Funds are spent. We collected and standardised all available beneficiary lists for the ERDF, ESF and CF for the 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 funding periods. These funds are partially funded by the EU and partially by the Member States allocated by regional authorities to the beneficiaries (read more on the policy). Find out who has received funding in your country.  </p>
