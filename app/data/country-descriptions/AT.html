<p> Austrian data is now available for both periods. 2007-2013 was made up of 9 single datasets, originally published in PDF. The dataset contains the basic information on: beneficiary name, operation name, total amounts and project status. 2014-2020 data is of a better standard, but does not cover many projects yet. The amounts present in the data are "total amounts" and therefore diverge from the EU's metadata, which only shows the EU's share and not the total project cost (EU + member state amount).  </p>
