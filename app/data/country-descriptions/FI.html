<p> For Finland, data for ERDF and ESF for both funding periods is available. It could be downloaded in CSV directly from the countryâ€™s ESIF website, but had lots of errors which had to be fixed. The amounts present in the data are "total amounts" and therefore diverge from the EU's metadata, which only shows the EU's share and not the total project cost (EU + member state amount). </p>
