<p> The 2007-2013 data for Malta had to be scraped from the countryâ€™s ESIF website. However, it is very detailed and offers distinctions for all funds, management authorities, investment priorities and project descriptions. The 2014-2020 data was only recently released in PDF, but we scraped it for both the ERDF and the ESF. The amounts present in the data are "total amounts" and may diverge from the EU's metadata, which only shows the EU's share and not the total project cost (EU + member state amount).
