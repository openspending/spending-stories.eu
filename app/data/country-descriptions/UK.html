<p> The UK data for 2007-2013 consists of one dataset that includes: Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland, England. The 2014-2020 data was collected and covers all funds for England, Northern Ireland and Wales. Amounts are originally in British Pounds, but we converted them to Euro in the additional variable <i>amount</i>, which is depicted here. Due to the data originally being from different sources, the amount variables differ between the countries, so aggregation does not add up to the EU's metadata.  </p>
