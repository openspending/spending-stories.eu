<p style="display: none;"> The UK data for 2007-2013 was difficult, because it consists only of PDFs divided per country: Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland, England. The 2014-2020 data was collected and covers all funds for England, Northern Ireland and Wales. Amounts for all datasets are in British pounds (GBP) - only the <i>amount</i>  variable was converted. </p>
