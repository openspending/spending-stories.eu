<p> Estonian data is available for both funding periods and all funds are available in one dataset at the countryâ€™s ESIF website and had to be scraped from the Estonian ESIF website. We are missing CCI codes and the fund names, which make it difficult to distinguish ERDF, ESF or CF projects. The dataset includes both the 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 funding period. The amount presented is the EU cofinancing amount in Euro for both periods. </p>
