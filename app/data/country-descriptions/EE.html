<p style="display: none;"> Estonian data is available for both funding periods and all funds in one dataset. The data had to be scraped from the Estonian web portal. We are missing CCI codes and the fund names, which make it difficult to distinguish ERDF, ESF or CF projects. The data is comprehensive including project names, beneficiaries, co-financing amounts, management authorities and priority axes. </p>
