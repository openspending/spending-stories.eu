<p style="display: none;"> Portuguese data was available for both funding periods (2007 - 2013 and 2014 - 2020) and includes all funds ERDF, ESF, and CF. The dataset itself is very rich containing operational programmes, priority labels, addresses and additional amounts. Classifying the amounts was difficult, so check the original files when in doubt. </p>
