<p> The 2007-2013 data for Italy was the most detailed dataset we came across. Due to its size we could only include the most important information. Italian data for 2014-2020 has only been released on the level of operational programmes, therefore, not showing individual beneficiaries, but regional programmes. Amounts presented are EU cofinancing amounts. </p>
