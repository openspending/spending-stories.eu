<p> For the Czech Republic, the ERDF data could be downloaded in Excel format. Data for both the 2007-2013 and the 2014-2020 period is available, however, the ESF data could not be located. Amounts are originally in Czech Krona, but we converted them to Euro in the additional variable  <i>amount</i>, which is depicted here. Beware that the Czech data diverges largely from the EU's data, we assume this is due to third party financing being included. </p>
