<p> Both Swedish datasets for 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 had to be scraped from the countryâ€™s ESIF website. However, they do not allow for distinguishing between the ERDF and the ESF. Amounts are originally in Swedish Krona, but we converted them to Euro in the additional variable <i>amount</i>, which is depicted here. The amounts present in the data are "total amounts" and may diverge from the EU's metadata, which only shows the EU's share and not the total project cost (EU + member state amount). </p>
