<p> The Belgium data is made up of different regional datasets (Brussels, Flanders, Wallonia) due to its federal structure. The Wallonia beneficiary data for 2007-2013 follows a difficult format and remains to be scraped. 2014-2020 data is available for all regions, but includes very little projects, up to now. The data released by the regions differs in quality and should be compared carefully. Due to substantial data missing, the sums do not add up to official EU data. </p>
