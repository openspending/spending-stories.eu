<p style="display: none;">The Belgium data is made up of different regional datasets (Brussels, Flanders, Wallonia) due to its federal structure. The Wallonia beneficiary data for 2007-2013 could not be located. 2014-2020 data is available for all regions, but includes very little projects. The data released by the regions differs in quality and should be compared carefully.</p>
