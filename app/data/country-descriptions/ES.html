<p> The Spanish data is only available for the 2007-2013 period so far. We have only included the ERDF and ESF datasets, which were made up of regional PDFs that had to be scraped. The amounts present in the data are "total amounts" and therefore diverge from the EU's metadata, which only shows the EU's share and not the total project cost (EU + member state amount). The 2014-2020 data has not been released as of February 2017. </p>
