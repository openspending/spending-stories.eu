<p> Irish data is published on the regional level and was hard to gather due to state specific ESIF websites. We are still lacking ESF data for 2007-2013. Beneficiary list for the 2014 - 2020 period has not been published. The amounts present in the data are "total amounts" and may diverge from the EU's metadata, which only shows the EU's share and not the total project cost (EU + member state amount).  </p>
