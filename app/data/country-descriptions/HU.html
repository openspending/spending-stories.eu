<p> The data for Hungary had to be scraped from the countryâ€™s website and is available for both periods and even the 2000 - 2006 period (in the concatenated dataset). Amounts are originally in Hungarian Forint, but we converted them to Euro in the additional variable  <i>amount</i>, which is depicted here. Furthermore, the amounts present in the data are "total amounts" and therefore diverge from the EU's metadata, which only shows the EU's share and not the total project cost (EU + member state amount). </p>
