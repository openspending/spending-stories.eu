<p style="display: none;"> Bulgarian data could be directly downloaded from the countryâ€™s ESIF website. It is very basic in nature but covers both the 2007-2013 and the 2014-2020 period. It does not include any information on dates so distinction between periods is not possible. Amounts are presented in the Bulgarian currency LEV. We added an additional variable  <i>amount</i>, where the currency was converted to Euro. </p>
