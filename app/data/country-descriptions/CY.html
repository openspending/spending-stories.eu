<p> For Cyprus we located one dataset that contains ERDF and Cohesion Fund Beneficiaries 2007 - 2013. The ESF data for both periods was indicated on the countryâ€™s ESIF website, but not available as of January 2017. Raw data could be easily downloaded from the portal, but needed extensive cleaning. It contains basic information such as beneficiary name, project names, dates, amounts, region and priority axis. </p>
