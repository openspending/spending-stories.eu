<p style="display: none;"> German Datasets are published on state-level, separately for funds and periods. For 2007-2013 most data in PDF and had to be scraped, so beware that data might not be perfect. The 2014-2020 was mostly published in XLSX and is more detailed than the previous periodâ€™s. Quality of information may vary depending on regions. </p>
